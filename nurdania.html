      </div>
      <p>I started my academic journey when I was 5 years old. I used to cry every morning when my mom dropped me off because I was too scared to do everything at kindergarten without her. It continues to be that way for 2 months. However, my teacher suddenly asked me if I wanted to join a speech competition because she said I am good at memorizing text. After that, I enjoyed going to school because I kept winning competitions, and I also became more brave to interact with others.</p>

      </div>
      <p>My primary school period was a bittersweet for me. I gained so many new friends and I lost some of them too. After I entered primary school, I actively joined various competitions. For example, story-telling competitions, chess competitions, scrabble competitions, & badminton competitions. Due to that, I sometimes only stay at school until the first lesson. However, I seriously enjoyed committing to so many competitions because I got to experience going to a lot of other schools at that time.</p>

      </div>
      <p>My secondary school was the best period ever. I learned a lot of things that helped me to be a better person. I met so many amazing and good friends. I got to discover new things with my friends. I stopped joining competitions because I am not good at multitasking. I know if I join more activities, I will not be able to focus more at study. Thus, I chose to just enjoy my school life with just study with my friends at school.</p>

      <p>It was my first time living far away from my family. I used to feel nervous every day because I did not know how to adapt to the environment at this university. But as I met my friends who somehow share the same thoughts and worries, it gave me the strength to gain knowledge and join many activities together. I hope I will successfully graduate with my friends by next year.</p>
